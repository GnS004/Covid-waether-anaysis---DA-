# Covid Weather Analysis — Data Analysis (DA)

## 📊 Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to investigate the relationship between **COVID-19 metrics** and **weather parameters**. The goal is to explore and visualize how weather conditions (like temperature, humidity, etc.) may correlate with COVID-19 case trends across regions/dates.

## 🧠 Objective

- Explore patterns and trends in COVID-19 data.
- Analyze weather datasets alongside COVID-19 statistics.
- Visualize correlations and insights using charts and plots.

This analysis helps in understanding whether weather conditions have any influence on COVID-19 spread or severity.

## 🔍 Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - COVID-19 dataset containing cases, deaths, recoveries, etc.
   - Weather dataset covering temperatures, humidity, wind speed, etc.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handling missing values and inconsistent records.
   - Formatting dates and merging datasets on common keys.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
   - Statistical summaries (mean, median, trends).
   - Time series visualization of cases vs. weather conditions.

4. **Visualization**
   - Heatmaps showing correlation between features.
   - Trend plots over time (cases vs. temperature/humidity).
   - Bar charts and histograms for comparative analysis.
